<h1>Lets gooo!</h1>

<p>DaBaby was born Jonathan Kirk in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1991. By age six, he'd relocated to Charlotte, and spent his adolescence engaged in street life. 
    In December 2014, Kirk made a quick decision to become a rapper, taking the name Baby Jesus and issuing his NonFiction mixtape a month later. 
    Never having been on a stage before, he headed to South by Southwest in the spring of 2015 and began making a name for himself with his visceral live performances. 
    Kirk changed his name to DaBaby, going so far as to explain the "political reasons" for this decision in the lyrics to "DaBaby (Intro)," a short introduction to 2016's God's Work Resurrected, his first mixtape under the new moniker. 
    This release featured a cameo from Boosie Badazz and began to attract the attention of fans and peers alike.</p>
<p>DaBaby's regional acclaim and endless hustle led to a major-label deal in 2019 when he signed on with Interscope. The label quickly released the Billboard 200 Top Ten hit Baby on Baby in March of that year, a sharply produced full-length that was preceded by increasingly surreal videos for singles "Suge" and "Walker, Texas Ranger." 
    After a string of features, DaBaby returned to solo work in September of that year, releasing the introspective single "Intro." A deeply personal track that dealt with the death of his father, "Intro" became the first single from his sophomore album, KIRK.
     Featuring major-label contributions from the likes of Nicki Minaj, Chance the Rapper, and Migos, the album was released later that month and entered the Billboard 200 at number one. DaBaby received two Grammy nominations for "Suge," Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. 
     In April 2020, he returned with his third studio album, Blame It on Baby, which featured appearances by Future, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Ashanti, Megan Thee Stallion, and others. Included on the album was the chart-topping Billboard Hot 100 single "Rockstar" with Roddy Ricch.</p>
