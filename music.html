  <h1>His rapping</h1>

  <p>DaBaby won’t acknowledge it easily, but what has become his calling card is a staccato, precise, and brutal rapping style, a syllable-crushing force delivered with such forward momentum it often gives the illusion that he starts rapping before the beat begins. 
      The most famous example of this is “Suge,” DaBaby’s biggest and most thrilling hit, in which it takes DaBaby only nine seconds to let out a “haaah” followed by “Pack in the mail, it’s gone / She like how I smell, cologne / I just signed a deal, I’m on.” 
      Between and behind those moments are an “Uh,” followed by three “Yeahs,” all of which add to the sense that no rapper has ever been as excited about fragrances and/or getting on than DaBaby. That’s the flow everyone’s talking about. 
      After some prodding and a few examples, he finally relents.</p>
